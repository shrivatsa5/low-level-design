This is an example for strategy pattern

Drive Mode is an interface with 2 modes - sports and normal drive mode
Vehicle is an interface . Each vehicle will have a drive mode 
NormalVehicle  SportsVehicle and OffRoadVehicle inherit the Vehicle class.
NormalVehicle has normal drive mode whereas SportsVehicle and OffRoadVehicle have sports drive mode

By having a drive mode interface within Vehicle, code duplication is avoided. If not SportsVehicle and OffRoadVehicle would have to contain definition of drive() method
